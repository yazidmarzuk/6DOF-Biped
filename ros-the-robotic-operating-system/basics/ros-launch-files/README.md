# ROS Launch Files

* In the previous sections you must have noticed that we need to use `roscore` command to start ROS Master and Parameter Server, `rosrun` command to run a ROS Node, `rosparam load` command to load parameters etc.
* This is a tedious process to manually run nodes and load parameters.
* Launch files provides the capability to do all these stuff using a single command.
* The idea is to mention all the nodes that you want to run, all the config file that you want to load etc in a single file which you can run using `roslaunch` command.
